            <h2>Basic Care</h2>
            <b>Coat:</b>
            Aussies require daily or weekly bruising due to their moderate/heavy shedding. Use a slicker brush and an undercoat rake when brushing them.<br>
            
            <b>Nails:</b>
            You should trim an Aussie’s nails every 2 weeks or when you notice they are overgrown. Use a dog nail trimmer or take them to the vet.<br>
            
            <b>Teeth:</b>
            Aussies need their teeth brushed daily or every other day. Do not use regular toothpaste as it could harm them. Instead, use a dog toothbrush and toothpaste.<br>
            
            <b>Shower:</b>
            Showering is only needed a few times a year or when your dog is very dirty. You should refrain from showering too often as it removes the dog’s natural oils.<br>
            
            <b>Food:</b>
            Aussies need a nutritious diet to stay healthy, and their needs may differ between puppies and adults. Make sure the food you buy is AAFCO approved. Puppies need about 22% protein and 8% fat in their diet while adults need 18% protein and 5% fat. You should also include essential vitamins and minerals in their meals. When choosing dog food, avoid fillers, preservatives, and artificial flavors.<br>
            <b>Exercise:</b>
            Aussies require one to two hours of exercise per day. Along with walking them, you can play fetch, go hiking, swim, give them chew or puzzle toys, or teach them tricks.<br>
            
            
            <b>Training:</b>
            It’s important to train Aussies at an early age (about 8 weeks old) to discourage negative behavior like herding, biting, or barking. However, refrain from yelling or punishing your Aussies and instead use positive reinforcement like praise or treats.<br>
            
            <b>Socialization</b>
            Aussies need socialization most at 7 weeks to 4 months of age. Taking them to dog parks, setting up playdates, and enrolling them in doggy daycare are great ways to socialize them with other dogs.<br>
